For each disease 1's set of linked SNPs, for each disease 2, the average effect size of disease 1 linked SNPs is calculated for disease 2 (which leads to 11 average effect sizes for disease 1 SNPs, one for each disease 2). Then a number of random samples of SNPs (1000 in this case) of the same number of disease 1 SNPs for which there was a known effect size for disease 2 are chosen and their average effect sizes are calculated. Using this permutation test, we can determine whether or not the effect size for disease 1 SNPs with respect to disease 2 is significant or not by calculating a simple p-value of (total samples - # random samples where the effect size for the disease 1 sample > effect size for random sample) / (total samples).
